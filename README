FUNCyms test suite

Summary:
        This test suite consists of testing basic YMS APIs exposed to northbound
        apps and southbound drivers/providers. We make use a YMS test app which
        uses YANG files for its data modelling. Using onos-yang-tools the java
        files are auto-generated for each of the YANG files. YMS test app provides
        CLIs to verify various APIs exposed by YMS; such as, service registration at
        northbound, device schema addition, YANG codec encode and decode in southbound.
        The following is an overview of the test.
        Steps:
            - Activate apps yms, restconf, ymstest
            - ymstest app register services in YMS
            - Test POST/PUT/GET/DELETE.. RestConf operations for the services
            - Verify the app data store contents
            - ymstest app adds device schema in YMS and YANG codec
            - Test YANG codec encode/decode flows
            - Verify the encode/decode output

Topology:
        The topology consists of only one ONOS controller. The YMS test app in ONOS
        only tests the YMS APIs at NB and SB. The app is acting as a provider at SB for
        testing purpose only.

Required:
        This test requires onos-yang-tools and yms, restconf, ymstest apps. The test
        will download the above tools and apps code from corresponding git reprository
        and build. Further clean build is done in onos folder and onos package is
        generated afterwards.
